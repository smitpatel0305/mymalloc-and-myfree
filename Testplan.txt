NOTE: In all workloads, if an error occurs during malloc or free,
the user is notified through an error message telling them they
are doing wrong.

1. Large workload
  Try to malloc the whole memory of 4096 bytes, 
  to see if whole memory can be allocated.

2. Invalid workload
  Try to malloc 0 size block, which is not correct.
  Try to free NULL pointer, which is not correct.
  Try to free pointer, which is set inside the allocated block, ex. (ptr + 10).
